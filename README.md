## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

![Diagrama de Arquitetura AWS](assets\architecture.drawio.png)

**Components:**
- **Frontend**: Static website served from a Docker container
- **Infrastructure**:  
  - ECS Fargate (serverless containers)  
  - Application Load Balancer (ALB)  
  - VPC with public subnets in two Availability Zones  
  - CloudWatch for monitoring
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions pipeline

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

### Tools Required
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) (‚â• v1.0)
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) (v2)

### AWS Requirements
- AWS account with permissions to:
  - Create ECS, VPC, and ALB resources
  - Create IAM roles
- AWS CLI profile configured

### GitHub Requirements
- Repository secrets configured:
  - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
  - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ascan-devops.git
cd ascan-devops/infra
```
### 2. Initialize Terraform
```bash
terraform init
```
### 3. Configure variables
Copy the example file and update with your values:
```bash
cp terraform.tfvars terraform.tfvars
```
Edit the file:
```bash
region       = "us-east-1"
docker_image = "your-dockerhub-username/your-image:tag"
```
### 4. Deploy infrastructure
```bash
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

## üöÄ Deployment Workflow
### CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Triggered on push to main branch
- Authenticates with AWS using repository secrets
- Deploys to the existing ECS service

### Manual Deployment
- Update `docker_image` in `terraform.tfvars`
- Run:
```bash
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

## üåê Accessing the Website
After successful deployment, run:
```bash
terraform output website_url
```
Open the URL in your browser.

## üí∞ Cost Considerations
This setup uses AWS Free Tier eligible resources:
- **ECS Fargate:** 750 hours/month with 0.25 vCPU
- **ALB:** 750 hours/month

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** ALB might incur minimal charges beyond Free Tier. Monitor your AWS billing dashboard regularly.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting
### Website not reachable
- Check that the ALB DNS output is correct:
```bash
terraform output website_url
```
- Ensure ECS tasks are running
- Make sure security groups allow HTTP (port 80) traffic

### Deployment issues
- Review logs in GitHub Actions
- Confirm IAM roles and permissions
- Verify Docker image exists and is public

### Terraform errors
- Try:
```bash
terraform init -upgrade
```
- Double-check variable values and file paths

### üßπ Cleanup
To destroy all created resources:
```bash
terraform destroy -auto-approve
```
> **‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: This will permanently delete all deployed infrastructure.**
